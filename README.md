# iTheon's New Tasks Addon v0.1.1

This mod adds several new repeatable quests to Stalker Anomaly that bring some fresh air to the vanilla set of quests that are very similar to each other.
Note: "During the night" refers to 10 PM - 3 AM.
Changelog available at the bottom.

Currently available quests with short descriptions (you'll find more in-depth story behind when talking with NPCs):

**From important NPCs:**

Petrenko:
- Hold the Ground - defend the Flea Market from bandit invasion.

Lukash:
- Skyfall - destroy a military helicopter

Dushman:
- No step back - take back part of Limansk and hold against storming monolith forces.

Sakharov:
- Brain game - kill a controller without damaging its head.

Voronin:
- Urgent orders - this quest is assigned automatically to Dutyer (original Dutyer - disguise won't work) to give a more military-like feeling to the faction. Go to Yantar and bring back a squad of sciencists to save wounded soldier with limited time (5 in game hours)

Kuznetsov:
- Urgent orders - same as Voronin's quest but for military.

Sidor:
- Dead night - investigate the disappearance of stalkers in Darkscape at night.

Barman:
- Baba Yaga - investigate the disappearance of stalkers on Garbage at night.

Cold:
- House of Horrors - an eviscerated sentry has been found at the seemingly safe Clear Sky outpost. You need to look into this case.

Beard:
- Mirage - an artifact hunter has barely made it out alive after being shot by someone who looked exactly like him. You need to investigate the place.

Trapper:
- Big Game - a pack of pseudogiants has taken refuge in a train tunnel in Jupiter. Trapper asks you to eliminate the threat.
 
**From random NPCs:**

Freedom:
- Gambling with life - kill a healthy bloodsucker using only a knife

Bandits:
- Vengence amplified - finish-off chimera using an axe (can be damaged by anyone and with any weapon before)
