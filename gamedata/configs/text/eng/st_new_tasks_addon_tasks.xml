He saw a group of newbies from afar that stopped by the Witches' Jelly anomaly to pick up an artifact. After one of them reached out for it, they've disappeared in a brief flash. Their screams were heard from the woods for a few seconds. Butcher knew it's already too late to save them, so he stood there and waited. For a brief moment, he saw a thin silhouette of an elderly woman. He didn't feel like chasing a ghost at night, so he went there next day just to find bare bones of the stalkers. He tried to hunt down the monster during the day, but it never showed up. He warned all stalkers that passed by about it and that's how the story of Baba Yaga was born among the stalkers - you know... that scary old lady from children's tales living at the swamp or in the forest that abducts children venturing too far away from home.\n \nButcher has also paid me a visit recently. He was trying to find out what's haunting that place, but it seems like the monster is smart enough to avoid that killing machine. Since a lot more experienced stalkers visit Rostok, he asked me to find someone willing to deal with that hag. What do you say?</text>

Just a moment before laying down to get some sleep, he heard shots coming from the campfire's direction and loud steps of someone dashing out of the hangar. When he got to the campfire with his gun in the hands, he saw only two bodies and none of them was the suspicious guy that he remembered. He found a note about the contract on leader's body and let me know about the incident.\n \nThat bastard has probably seen an artifact like this for the first time and decided to kill his brothers just to snatch it, while also double-crossing me.

		<text>Listen up, mate. As you should already know, we call this place ours and we treat it really seriously. From time to time we have visitors that seem to not understand that and they usually end bad. Our boys have spotted a group of eggheads sniffing around the Glowing Pit. Since they usually carry some advanced artifact detectors and that place is quite dangerous, our boys decided to let the eggheads do the dirty job and then take whatever they find there from their dead bodies. When they spotted that our guests are packing some sparkling goodies to the lead box, one of our best shots lifted his SKS, getting ready to shoot. Right at that same moment his head literally exploded... he took a sniper round to the head. The rest of his squad did not know where the shot came from, so they ran for their lives as fast as they could. When a bigger group went back there, they were nowhere to be found. They also took our dead brother's stuff.\n \nIt's us who take stuff from others here - not the other way around... Find these bastards, teach them this lesson and bring the box back to me.</text>

		<text>Hah - there it is. It won't bring our brother back to life, but will definitely lift the spirits around.</text>
