		<text>Our lads have reported that some Loners have disappeared recently on their way from the Darkscape sawmill to our village. The path was always relatively safe, so folks often traveled at night to avoid bandits and soliders. Their screams in the dark were heard by the guys staying at the sawmill, but noone was brave enough to risk their life trying to help them. The bodies of the missing stalkers have not been found after the dawn. Stalkers around here have gathered a small sum for someone willing to investigate what happened.</text>

Only one man has lived to tell the story.

One of our fellas - still high as fuck - overheard his talking and went out of the base that night. He never came back, but the bet still stands. Poor guy... wondering what happened to him...\n\nNow where was I? Ah, right - the bet! You seem like a tough guy. Wouldn't you like to try your luck? I'll mount a small camera on your suit so that I can later show that video to my pal. What - you didn't think that I'd tell you his name here, right? Want something for myself out of this as well.\n\nRemember - there's one catch - the mutant has to be healthy.

		<text>I'm always glad seeing young people so eager to contribute to scientific projects! You see - we've been researching the mysteries of the Zone for a very long time now and yet there's still so much to learn. One of the most fascinating and at the same time most dangerous marvels of the Zone are controllers. Stalkers usually tend to avoid confrontation with them and when it's inevitable, they - understandably so - want to eliminate it as soon as possible by shooting it to the head. That's why most of the brain samples we get are of very little use to us. It would be most appreciated if you'd kill one of these without damaging its brain and informed us of this event as soon as possible, so we can send a group that'd secure it and make sure it gets to us before its tissues start decomposing.</text>
